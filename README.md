# Parser Combinators in Scala 3.x

This project implements the building blocks for writing
Scala parsers using the parser combinators idiom. The following
building blocks are expected:

   * [x] item  
   * [x] sat
   * [x] many
   * [ ] biased choice
   * [ ] sequency

## Goals

   * Understand functional programming via parser combinators
   * Understand the Scala 3.x features
   
## Run the test cases

```$ sbt test```
